# Bartending Buddy

## Description

This is the Bartending Buddy. This app is designed to help anybody make professional grade drinks in a matter of minutes. Utlizing React for a smooth and quick experience, API calls are made to the cocktail database to return recipies, instructions as well as visual aids to assist users in making the drinks they want. Users can also upload their own recipes into the bartending buddy to share and collaborate with other users. The user generated recipes are added to a firebase store using redux. This app is not overly complicated. I wanted to make an application that I would like to use, and also showcased what I was especially excited about in web design. I am personally interested in the UX UI and design aspects of coding to create intuitive, enjoyable, and eye catchingly designed websites.
